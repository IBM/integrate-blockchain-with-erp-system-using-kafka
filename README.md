# Integrate Blockchain with ERP Systems for Business benefits using Kafka

Very seldom private and permissioned blockchain based applications operate in silos. Usually they are integrated with the existing systems such as ERP/Core Banking/Asset Management etc. There are many ways to achieve this. Consider a scenario wherein one of the participating org is using ERP systems and needs to use blockchain for business benefits.

Problems we need to solve are-

* Which system/systems to update first? Why?
* How can eventual consistency across all the systems (including blockchain) can be guaranteed?
* How to make user experience better? Eg. Avoid re submits from user, consistent messaging and notifications etc.
* How to handle higher throughputs? Especially considering that blockchain TPS may not be in comparison with centralized database-based systems.

One promising solution to address these problems is using kafka based distributed messaging middleware.

We plan to show how to integrate Blockchain with Kafka in this code pattern and use it for business benefits.
